What happens when we run docker conatiner run?

    1. Looks for that image in image chache, doesn't find anything.
    2. Then looks for it in remote image repository (docker hub).
    3. Downloads the latest version (nginx:latest). Save it in image cache
    4. Creates a container using that image.
    5. Gives it a virtual ip on the private network inside docker engine.
    6. Opens a port 80 on the host and forwards to port 80 in the container.
    7. starts container by using the CMD in the image Dockerfile.


    docker conatiner run --publish 8080:80 --name webhost -d nginx:1.11 nginx(change cmd on start) -T
