Image Vs Container

> An image is an application we want to run
> A Container is an instance of that image running as a process
> You can have many conatiners running off the same image
> Here our image will be nginx webserver
> Docker's default image "registry" is called Docker hub (hub.docker.com)


> docker container run --publish 80:80 nginx

    1. Downloaded image nginx from docker hub
    2. Started a new conatiner from that image
    3. Openend port 80 on the host IP
    4. Routes that traffic to container IP, port 80
