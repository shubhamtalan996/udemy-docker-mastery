Image Vs Container

> An image is an application we want to run
> A Container is an instance of that image running as a process
> You can have many conatiners running off the same image
> Here our image will be nginx webserver
> Docker's default image "registry" is called Docker hub (hub.docker.com)


> docker container run --publish 80:80 nginx

    1. Downloaded image nginx from docker hub
    2. Started a new conatiner from that image
    3. Openend port 80 on the host IP
    4. Routes that traffic to container IP, port 80

> crl + c to kill the container

> docker container run --publish 80:80 --detach nginx (you will get an conatiner id)

> docker container ls

> docker container stop id...(add in id chars till it is unique)

> docker container ls -a

> docker container run --publish 80:80 --detach --name webhost nginx

> docker container ls -a

> docker container logs webhost

> docker container top webhost (lists processes inside conatiner)

> docker container ls -a

> docker container rm 614 6e39 039e 7cb 4675

Got error: cannot terminate running container (Now we are going to do it either stop then remove or forcefully remove it)

> docker container ls -a
